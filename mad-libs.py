print (f"""Today, I woke up early in the morning and went {activity1} and {verb1}. After I drove to the location, I met up with {noun1} and {noun2} at the old {location1}. After we started walking and talked about {dialogue1}, 
something unexpected occured. A big, scary {noun3} jumped out, revealing itself. We all screamed {dialogue2} and we ran in the other direction.
After we all got tired, we hid in the {location2} and prayed that that horrid thing would pass. However, after {adjective1} minutes, we decided
to take a peak. But we saw the {noun3} staring us dead in the eye, a face-distance away. We screamed in a delerious frenzy, tackling the {noun3}
and overpwering it with ease. We tied it up, shouting {dialogue3} at it, before we tied the thing up and burned it. It shouted {dialogue4} loudly
before burning up into ashes. We were all {adjective2} and let out a big sigh. I suggested that we go to the {location3} to {activity2} our close
call. We all got in my friend's {noun1}'s {noun4} and drove off into the sunrise. A while into the drive, the thought came to me: Hey, where is {noun5}?
A wave of shock it me as I remembered the creatures last words: {dialogue4}, as a sudden feeling of {adjective3}!""")
